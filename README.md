# erl(learn)

I created this repo to put the code that I wrote while learning Erlang through its [official guide](http://erlang.org/doc/getting_started/users_guide.html) and some shallow reading on [Learn you some Erlang for Great good book](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/), which I really recomend.

The contribution of my studies can be found on the script ```matrix.erl``` that multiplies two matrices on different sizes (as long as they respect the Matrix Multiplication dimension constraints). This was also be uploaded on Rosetta code [[https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication#Erlang]].
_(Yey, I was able to contribute to Rosetta code!)_

I've also implemented a parallel (actually distribuited) version of this algorithm, which can be found on ```matrix_p.erl```. You can get a better idea behind it by first reading its sequential version.
